# refactoring-html-project
Code refactored by following the assignemnt given. Main focus was to provide acessibility and improve codebase. In this assigment, I have changed tags in the html as well as class names and fixed links that were not correctly connected. in the CSS file, I have minimized the use of classes and added animation to the Nav bar. The main focus on the CSS file was to use the least amount of "Class" using tags from the HTML instead.
